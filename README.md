Bayesian Statistics
This checkpoint is designed to test your understanding of applying Bayes' theorem.

Specifically, this will cover:

Interpreting a word problem and applying Bayes' theorem
Manipulating the elements of Bayes' theorem to a given problem context
Your Task: Calculate Probabilities Using Bayes' Theorem
Problem Context
Thomas is going to get a new puppy. There are two major decisions involved: what location he gets the puppy from, and what size the puppy is.

The possible locations for getting the puppy are the pet store or the pound. These are mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive probabilities, meaning that Thomas will only go to one location, and there is a 100% probability that he will go to one of these two locations. We'll represent those probabilities as 
 and 
 as needed.

The possible puppy sizes are small, medium, or large. Again, these are mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive probabilities, so a given puppy has only one size and there is a 100% probability that Thomas will get a puppy with one of these three sizes. We'll represent those probabilities as 
, 
, and 
 as needed.

Known Probabilities
The probability of Thomas going to the pet store is 20%
If he goes to the pet store, the probability of him getting a small puppy is 60%
If he goes to the pet store, the probability of him getting a medium puppy is 30%
If he goes to the pet store, the probability of him getting a large puppy is 10%
If he goes to the pound, the probability of him getting a small puppy is 10%
If he goes to the pound, the probability of him getting a medium puppy is 35%
If he goes to the pound, the probability of him getting a large puppy is 55%
Formula Reminders
This is the formula for Bayes' theorem:

 

In other words, the probability of A given B is the probability of B given A times the probability of A, divided by the probability of B.

Additionally, recall the law of total probability:

 

In other words, the probability of A is the sum of all (probability of A given B times the probability of B) for all B.
